# Ecclesial Ethics Reframing

A methodology for shifting ethical questions from individualistic deliberation to community-based formation, derived from Stanley Hauerwas's theological ethics and his insistence that "the church doesn't have a social ethic; the church IS a social ethic."

## The Core Principle

Ethics is not a solitary calculation performed by autonomous individuals weighing universal principles. Ethics is the formation of character through immersion in a community's story, practices, and accountability structures. The question is not "What should I do?" but "What kind of person is my community forming me to be?"

> "The most creative social strategy we have to offer is the church. Here we show the world a manner of life the world can never achieve through social coercion or governmental action."
> — Stanley Hauerwas

## The Problem: Individualistic Ethics

Modern Western ethics typically operates on these assumptions:

1. **The isolated individual** - Moral agents are autonomous selves making independent decisions
2. **Universal principles** - Ethics consists of principles accessible to all rational persons
3. **Private deliberation** - Moral decisions happen in the individual's mind through reasoning
4. **Values as possessions** - People "have" values like they have opinions
5. **Community as optional** - Groups are voluntary associations formed after identity is settled

This framework produces characteristic questions:
- "What should I do?"
- "What are my values?"
- "How do I decide?"
- "What's the right thing?"
- "It's a personal choice"

The problem: These questions assume an individual who already exists, apart from community, making decisions based on principles that came from nowhere.

---

## The Solution: Ecclesial Reframing

Hauerwas insists that ethics only makes sense within a community carrying a story:

1. **Character is formed, not chosen** - We become who we are through the communities that shape us
2. **Story precedes principle** - Moral principles are abstractions from concrete narratives
3. **Community makes ethics intelligible** - You cannot understand "courage" apart from a community that names it
4. **Practice precedes theory** - We learn ethics by doing, not by thinking
5. **The church is primary** - For Christians, the church is the community where ethics becomes real

The reframed questions:
- "What community is forming me?"
- "What story is that community living?"
- "What kind of person am I becoming through these practices?"
- "Who holds me accountable?"
- "Can I make this decision with my community, not alone?"

---

## Workflow
### Step 1: Identify the Individualist Frame

When someone presents an ethical question, notice the assumptions:
- Is the question framed as "I" deciding alone?
- Are they appealing to abstract "values" without source?
- Is community absent from the consideration?
- Are they treating ethics as information to be applied rather than formation to be undergone?

**Trigger phrases:**
- "What should I do?"
- "What's the right thing to do?"
- "How do I decide?"
- "It's a personal choice"
- "According to my values..."
- "What are my principles?"

### Step 2: Ask the Community Question

Shift attention from the isolated individual to the communities actually forming them:

**Questions to ask:**
- "What community are you actually part of?"
- "Not what community do you attend, but what community is forming your desires and habits?"
- "Who would you talk to about this? Whose opinion do you trust?"
- "Where did your 'values' come from? Who taught them to you?"
- "What group holds you accountable for your decisions?"

The goal is to make visible the communities that are already shaping the person, whether they acknowledge it or not.

### Step 3: Locate the Narrative

Every community lives by a story - a narrative that gives meaning to their life together:

**Questions to ask:**
- "What story is that community living?"
- "What is the beginning, middle, and end of that story?"
- "Who are the heroes? Who are the villains?"
- "What does that story say about what matters?"
- "What does that story say about how to live?"

For Christians: The story is creation, fall, redemption, consummation - God's action in Israel and Jesus to reconcile all things.

### Step 4: Shift the Question

Move from "What should I do?" to the formative question:

**The Shift:**
- FROM: "What is the right decision?"
- TO: "What kind of person is my community forming me to be, and does this choice serve or undermine that formation?"

This is not about finding the "right answer" but about understanding oneself as a character in an ongoing story, formed by practices, accountable to others.

### Step 5: Return to Practice

Decisions emerge from practices, not isolated deliberation:

**Questions to ask:**
- "What practices does your community engage in that shape how you see this situation?"
- "If you make this decision, what practices will you be participating in?"
- "How does your community's worship, service, or common life inform this situation?"
- "What would it look like to bring this decision to your community for discernment?"

### Step 6: Point to the Church (for Christians)

If the person is Christian, point them back to ecclesial identity:

**Questions to ask:**
- "Where is the church in your deliberation?"
- "What does your baptism say about who you are?"
- "What does the Eucharist teach you about how to live?"
- "The church is meant to be the community that forms Christians - are you allowing it to do that?"
- "Can you make this decision in the presence of your brothers and sisters?"

## Application Examples

### Example 1: Career Decision

**Individualist frame:** "I'm trying to figure out what's ethical regarding my career. I've been offered a job that pays better but I have moral concerns about the company."

**Ecclesial reframe:**
- What community is actually forming you right now?
- Where did your "moral concerns" about the company come from?
- Who would you talk to about this decision?
- Is the church involved in your deliberation at all?
- What kind of person is your community forming you to be, and does this job serve that?
- Can you bring this decision to your community and make it together?

### Example 2: Political Question

**Individualist frame:** "I'm trying to figure out my position on this political issue. What's the Christian view?"

**Ecclesial reframe:**
- There is no "Christian view" apart from the church living it out
- What does your church community believe and practice regarding this?
- How has the church historically engaged this kind of question?
- What story is the church living, and how does this issue fit within it?
- Instead of finding a "position," ask: What kind of community are we called to be?

### Example 3: Moral Struggle

**Individualist frame:** "I keep struggling with this habit. I know it's wrong but I can't stop."

**Ecclesial reframe:**
- Moral transformation is not a private project; it happens in community
- Who knows about this struggle? Who holds you accountable?
- What practices is your community offering that could form new habits?
- Have you confessed to anyone? Confession requires community
- The church is meant to be the community of character formation - are you letting it be that?

## Common Objections

### Objection 1: "But I have to make the decision - no one else can make it for me."

**Response:** True, you make the decision. But you do not make it alone, from nowhere. You are already formed by communities and stories. The question is whether you acknowledge this and bring the decision into your community's discernment, or whether you pretend to be an autonomous individual and cut yourself off from the wisdom and accountability of others.

### Objection 2: "My church isn't perfect. I can't trust them with this."

**Response:** No church is perfect - the church is made of sinners. But the answer is not to abandon the church for private deliberation. The answer is to help the church be more faithful. And even an imperfect church offers more wisdom than isolated individuals making decisions alone.

### Objection 3: "This sounds like groupthink or giving up my autonomy."

**Response:** The modern obsession with autonomy is itself a product of liberal individualism. We are always formed by communities - the only question is which ones. The issue is not whether to be formed, but by whom. Christian freedom is not the absence of formation but formation by the right story.

## The Deeper Teaching

### Why This Matters

The individualist approach to ethics is not merely incomplete - it is a form of self-deception. It pretends that we can reason our way to the good apart from the communities that formed us. It treats ethics as a technique rather than a way of life.

Hauerwas insists that this approach is not just impractical but unfaithful. It accepts the assumptions of liberal society (autonomous individuals, private values, procedural neutrality) rather than the assumptions of the Christian story (formed in Christ, embodied in community, accountable to one another).

### The Church as Alternative

The church is not a voluntary association of religious individuals. It is a *polis* - a political community with its own citizenship, practices, and story. The church does not exist to help individuals make better decisions. The church exists as an alternative social order - showing the world what redeemed human community looks like.

When we reframe ethics ecclesially, we are not just improving our decision-making. We are witnessing to a different understanding of what it means to be human.

## How to Use This Skill

**When someone presents with:**
- Individualistic ethical questions ("What should I do?")
- Abstract appeals to "values" or "principles" without source
- Private deliberation cut off from community
- Christian ethical questions that ignore the church
- Moral struggles treated as private projects

**Guide them through:**
1. Notice the individualist assumptions
2. Ask about community: Who is forming you? Who holds you accountable?
3. Locate the narrative: What story is that community living?
4. Shift the question: What kind of person is your community forming you to be?
5. Point to practice: What practices shape this decision?
6. Return to the church: Can you make this decision with your community?

## Sample Application

**Seeker says:** "I'm really struggling with whether it's okay to invest in certain industries. I want to make money but I also have ethical concerns. How do I figure out what's right?"

**Ecclesial Ethics Response:**

You've asked exactly the question that liberal society wants you to ask - "How do I figure out what's right?" - as if ethics were a calculation you perform in isolation.

Let me ask you some different questions.

What community are you part of? Not "what church do you attend," but who is actually forming your desires, your habits, your sense of what matters? When you say you have "ethical concerns" about certain industries - where did those concerns come from? Someone taught them to you. Some community carried them. Who was that?

And here's the harder question: Who holds you accountable? If you make this investment decision, who will know? Who will say, "Is that consistent with who we're trying to become together?"

See, the issue isn't really "what's the right answer about ethical investing." The issue is that you're trying to make this decision alone, as if you were an autonomous individual with a private set of values, running a cost-benefit analysis in your head.

That's not how Christians are supposed to live. We're supposed to live in community - formed by a story, shaped by practices, accountable to one another. The question isn't "What should I do?" The question is "What kind of person is my community forming me to be, and does this decision serve that formation?"

So here's my challenge: Don't decide this alone. Bring it to your community. Talk to your church about how you handle money. Let them hold you accountable. Make the decision together.

That's not giving up your responsibility. That's learning what it means to be human - not as an isolated individual, but as a member of the body of Christ.
